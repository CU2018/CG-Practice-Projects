# CG-Practice-Projects
This repo contains the URLs to my personal practice projects page.

During the winter break of 2021 to 2022 (before my 2nd term at UC - Berkeley!), I watched the online course COMPSCI 284A given by Professor Ren Ng at UC Berkeley and finished most of the projects in the course (except the final project). For the policy and requirement of the course, I didn't upload the source code to public repos. Instead, I created a README for each project as a demo. Here are the links to the project pages:
